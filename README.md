# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The project assists us in identifying the fraudulent entries in the given dataset.

# Dataset

The datasets contain credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a two-day period in September 2013. There are a total of 284,807 transactions, 492 (0.172 percent) of which are fraudulent.

The dataset contains numerical variables that have been transformed using principal components analysis (PCA). The original authors used this transformation to protect the confidentiality of sensitive information. The dataset also includes Time and Amount, which were not transformed by PCA. The Time variable stores the number of seconds that have passed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The transaction amount is represented by the Amount variable; this feature can be used for example-dependent cost-sensitive learning. The response variable is the Class variable, which indicates whether the transaction was fraudulent.
